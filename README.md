## Project setup

```
1. This project is a Camera viewer for the desktop and mobile devices.

2. On page load, the user is asked permission to access his webcam and he is then able to see a real-time image from his camera.

3. There is a button to switch between all available cameras, if any.
```

## To do improvements:

1. Access back facing camera on mobile device
2. Figure out how to use 'facing mode' for mobile device
